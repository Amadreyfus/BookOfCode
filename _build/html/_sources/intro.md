Welcome to the Book Of Code
============================

This book is primarily meant as a reference for myself in order to collect and
organize the useful coding syntax I am constantly forgetting across all
of the different languages I encounter.

Essentially, it is a binder of cheat sheets that takes advantage of the
functionality of Jupyter Book other packages in order to create a comprehensive
and easy to manage repository of commands and syntax with explanations.

It is meant to be a constant work in progress as I continuously add to the
existing content.
