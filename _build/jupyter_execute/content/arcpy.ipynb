    "### Step 1: Set up your arcpy workspace and allow for overwriting\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this grants the neccessary functionality to any files/interactions between arcpy and this folder.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It essentially establishes your working directory for any arcpy calls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overwriting allows you to overwrite previous files so you never have problems reexecuting commands.  \n",

    "#Setting up my arcpy workspace, basically my working directory for basic arcpy functions\n",
    "arcpy.env.workspace = r'C:\\Users\\SeanJ\\JupyterFolder\\CrashometryV2Data\\Connecticut\\IntermediateData'\n",
