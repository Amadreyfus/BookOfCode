# Time Series / Dates

Key ways of thinking about time in python:

- **Timestamp**: An instant in time
- **Period**: Some established interval of time, usually a month, year. Special case of interval
- **Interval**: An arbitrary interval of time.
- **Experimental / Elapsed time**: Represents elapsed time from some chosen start point.

Important Native-Python Packages concering date:

- [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
- [`dateutil`](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

from datetime import datetime
print(f'datetime.now() : {datetime.now()}')
print(f'datetime.now().year : {datetime.now().year}')

from dateutil import parser
date = parser.parse("4th of July, 2015")
date

Types available in the datetime module:

- `date` -   Date object (only concerned with calendar type dates)
- `time` -   Time object concerned with time of a date
- `datetime` -  Combo of both
- `timedelta` - Differences between to datetime objects
- `tzinfo` - Time zone things

## Strings and strftime

Once you have a datetime object or some date ready to be converted into one, it is easy to convert and format into a string

stamp = datetime.now()
print(str(stamp))

stamp.strftime('%Y-%m')

(strf)=
### Strftime

**strftime** allows you to select certain parts of the datetime object with using the special formatting codes. Here is a list of common ones: (ISO C89 compatible)

- `%Y` : 4 digit year
- `%y` : 2 digit year
- `%m` : 2 digit month
- `%d` : 2 digit day
- `%H` : military time hour
- `%h` : 12 hour [01,12]
- `%M` : 2 digit minute [00,59]
- `%S` : seconds [00,61]
- `%w` : weekday as an integer
- `%F` : shortcut for `%Y-%m-%d`
- `%D` : shortcut for `%d/%m/%y`


Here is a list of useful locale-specific **strftime** codes:

- `%a` : abbreviated day name
- `%A` : Full-length day name
- `%b` : abbreviated month name
- `%B` : Full month name
- `%c` : full date-time (Tue 01 May 2012 04:20:57 PMâ€™)
- `%p` : locale equivalent of a.m./p.m.
- `%x` : locale-appropriate formatted date (%c)
- `%X` : locale-appropriate time

(datetime64)=
## Numpy [datetime64](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.datetime.html)

Like most native python objects and and processes - problems with efficiency and speed arise when dealing with large quantities and loops. 

The dypte **datetime64** was developed in order to address these problems.

The `datetime64` datatype encodes dates as 64 bit integers (which allows dates to be represented compactly)

import numpy as np
date = np.array('2020-07-04', dtype='datetime64[D]')
date

Dates in this format allow for vectorized operations. 
````{margin}
```{note}
Recall that alot of the speed attainable in `numpy` is due to the uniformity 
of dtype in numpy arrays
```
````

date + np.arange(6)

`datetime64` and `timedelta` are both built upon a **fundamental time unit** and so the range of encodable dates = 

$$ 2^{64} \cdot (t_{u}) $$

where $t_{u}$ is the smallest unit of time measured **(time resolution)** and the product above is the **max time span**  

$ns = 10^{-9}$ (nanoseconds) are the default ftu. but there are quite a few codes that can be used.

np.datetime64('2020-08-11', 'ns')

Here are the various codes for `datetime64`:  

- `Y` : year
- `M` : month
- `W` : ...
- `D` : 
- `h` : 
- `m` :
- `s` :
- `ms` : millisecond
- `us` : microsecond $10^{-6}$ one millionth of a second
- `ns` : nanosecond
- `ps` : picosecond $10^{-12}$ one trillionth of a second
- `fs` : femtosecond
- `as` : attosecond $10^{-18}$ one quintillionth of a second

## Dates and Times in Pandas

Pandas builds upon `datetime`, `dateutils`, and `datetime64` to provide objects such as `Timestamp` that takes the best part of each:  

The flexibility and ease of use of native `python3` packages, and the efficient storage and vectorized interface of `numpy`

import pandas as pd
date = pd.to_datetime('11 of August, 2020')
date

date.strftime("%A")
