(shifttab)=
## Shift + Tab in method parentheses

In a python method call that has optional arguments, i.e. `object.method()`, you can place the cursor inside the parantheses and press `Shift + Tab` to pull up documentation on the method.  

You can repeat this `Shift + Tab` operation up to 4 times each subsequent call modifying the information displayed with increasing duration, size, info....

(multiplefilter)=
## Applying multiple filter criteria to a DataFrame

In a dataframe with multiple columns you can use bitwise logical operators (`&`, `|`, `~`, `^`) to chain the filtering conditions together:   

For example:

```python
df[(df.column1 > value1) | (df.column2 == value1)]
```

Another nice trick for filtering a df based on certain values in a Series/columnd is to use `.isin()`

```python
df[df.column.isin([value1, value2, value3])
```
