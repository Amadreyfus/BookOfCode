# Intro and Table of Contents
<br />
<br />

This book is primarily meant as a reference for myself in order to collect and
organize the useful coding syntax I am constantly forgetting across all
of the different languages I encounter.

Essentially, it is a collection of cheat sheets that takes advantage of the
functionality of Jupyter Book in order to create a comprehensive
and easy to manage repository of commands and syntax with explanations.

This will be a work in progress as I continuously add to this project
and reorganize as my understanding of jupyter-book grows.

It is also an inherently selfish document in that I will only consider my frame
of reference in populating and organizing it. As a result, it will be idiosyncratic
in terms of its content and layout, although, hopefully, not egregiously so.


For anyone else interested in creating their own jupter-book,
instructions can be found at [https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html][jb].
